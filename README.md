About Me
My name is Abdulraman Ahmed Usman. I was born on February 2, 2008, in Kalshingi, Akko LGA, Gombe State. I began my educational journey in 2013 at Police Children School Yola, attended junior secondary school at Hayatu Iyawa College, Yola, and completed my senior secondary school at Gombe Children and High School, Gombe. Inspired by my father's dedication as a police officer with the Adamawa State Police Command, I aspire to make a difference in the field of medicine.

Why MBBS?
Choosing to pursue an MBBS degree is driven by my passion for healthcare and my desire to help others. The field of medicine offers a unique combination of challenges and rewards, providing opportunities to make a significant impact on people's lives.
